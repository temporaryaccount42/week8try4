                Hello, my name is Peter J Vanderhook. I was born at Lion’s Gate Hospital in Vancouver on June 4th, 1998 and grew up in a town up the coast called Squamish. While I was growing up, I could be found outside playing baseball or inside playing with my family’s computer. I was always interested in video games and found myself experimenting, in my teenager years, with different programming languages. I eventually was able to teach myself, and develop a text-based game, in both Python 2.0 and Java. </p>
            </div><div class="container">
                <p>When I was in grade 12, I was offered to join a younger class on a field trip to take the place of one of the students who was sick. I decided to go and so we piled in a van and went down to the Squamish Airport to a touring/flight training company called Glacier Air. We all hopped in a 1960’s Cessna and they took us around to see all of the different valleys, glaciers, and mountains in the area. I’ll never forget flying over Tabletop Mountain, it’s unique flat-top geography was caused by an active volcano underneath a flat glacier. After that flight I wanted to know more about flying fixed-wing aircraft and booked a ‘familiarization’ flight where I was able to take off and fly the plane with a flight instructor beside me. </p>
            </div><div class="container">
                <p>I found myself at a crossroad, where I had to make an important decision in life regarding my future career. I eventually decided to pursue my Commercial Pilot’s License (CPL) as a career and keep software development as a hobby. I applied to BCIT’s AVFO program and was accepted in January 2017. By October 2017 I had my Private Pilot’s License. Shortly after, I was forced to leave the program with several other students due to lack of available bookings. This was mainly caused by a combination of forest fires, bad weather, and poor organization. I did not give up however and pursued my training, completing my night rating over summer which allowed me to fly at night. </p>
            </div><div class="container">
                <p>I rejoined the program’s next class in January 2019 with a few of my old classmates, but Corona Virus made my flight training challenging. After completing and passing my commercial license written exam along with some other notable ratings, I dropped out and stopped pursuing the license. The industry started to look poor, and I had invested a lot of money. It was a very tough choice for me, and I was incredibly stressed during that year. </p>
            </div><div class="container">
                <p>After I stopped pursuing my CPL I started looking at other options. I began working again and paid off my loans and started applying to technology-oriented programs as the IT industry only seems to be getting better and better. After applying to several schools, I received a call from BCIT almost 9 months after I applied informing me that there was a spot available in the class. I instantly told them that I was still interested, and 2 months later here we are! </p>
            </div><div class="container">
                <p>I’m enjoying the classes so far and I feel very motivated to grow my knowledge on software and hardware. I love learning about these things that interest me, and I look forward to developing rapport with my fellow classmates. After I complete this program, I plan on taking the game dev course offered to CIT and CST grads. I hope to start my own software development company one day using what I learned from these programs.</p>
